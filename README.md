Omni-Notes
==========

Note taking <b>open-source</b> application aimed to have both a <b>simple interface</b> but keeping <b>smart</b> behavior.

The project was inspired by the absence of such applications compatible with old phones and old versions of Android. It aims to provide an attractive look and follow the most recent design guidelines of the Google operating system.

**Follow the developments and post your comments and advice on Google+ Beta Community at http://goo.gl/eF6qqF**

*Help to keep translations updated is always welcome, if you want give a hand checkout the translation project at [Crowdin][2].*

## User guide

Look into the wiki for GIFs-based tutorials: [LINK](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/wiki)

## Build

Watch the following terminal session recording on how to compile distributable files
[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/102898.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/102898)

## Test

To execute all tests included into the project connect a device or emulator, then run the following command:

```shell
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## Contributing

Due to the fact that I'm using [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) as code versioning methodology, you as developer should **always** start working on [develop branch](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/tree/develop) that contains the most recent changes.

Feel free to add yourself to [contributors.md](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/blob/develop/contributors.md) file.

**Don't forget to contribute to original code! Don't be selfish or lazy!**

### Test code contributions

All code changes and additions **must** be tested.
See the [related section](#test) about this.

### Fork project

When forking the project you'll have to modify some files that are strictly dependent from my own development / build / third-party-services environment. Files that need some attention are the following:

- *gradle.properties*: this is overridden by another file with the same name inside the *omniNotes* module. You can do the same or leave as it is, any missing property will let the app gracefully fallback on a default behavior.
- *.travis.yml*: if you use [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) as continuous integration platform and a SonarQUBE instance for code quality analysis you'll have to modify this file according to your needs.

## Code quality

A public instance of SonarQube is available both to encourage other developers to improve their code contributions (and existing code obviously) and to move the project even further into transparency and openness.

Checkout for it [here](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=omni-notes)

Pull requests will be automatically analyzed and rejected if they'll rise the code technical debt.

## Dependencies

They're all listed into the [build.gradle](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/blob/develop/omniNotes/build.gradle) file but due to the fact that many of the dependences have been customized by me I'd like to say thanks here to the original developers of these great libraries:
