Omni-Notes
==========

Note taking <b>open-source</b> application aimed to have both a <b>simple interface</b> but keeping <b>smart</b> behavior.

The project was created by the absence of such applications compatible with old phones and old versions of Android that would propose, however, an attractive look and aligned with the most recent design of the Google operating system


**Follow the developments and post your comments and advice on Google+ Beta Community at http://goo.gl/eF6qqF**

*Help to keep translations updated is always welcome, if you want give an hand checkout the translation project at [Crowdin][2]*

##Build the app

Due to the fact that I'm using [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) as code versioning methodology (even before it was formalized) you, as developer should **always** start working on [develop branch](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/tree/develop) that contains the most recent changes.

To simplify the approach with the app code I switched to the new Android Studio IDE (BETAs are ready to be daily used) and I created a personal [Maven repository](https://github.com/federicoiosue/repository) to avoid you to download all the libraries and sub-projects Omni Notes depends on.

Short story long: you have to clone from Omni Notes' develop branch on GitHub the code into Android Studio, wait for all dependencies have been downloaded and start coding!

**Don't forget to contribute to original code! Don't be selfish or lazy!**

####Dependences

They're all listed into the [build.gradle](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/blob/develop/omniNotes/build.gradle) file but due to the fact that many of the dependences have been customized by me I'd like to say thanks here to the original developers of these great libraries:

* https://github.com/derekbrameyer/android-betterpickers
* https://github.com/gabrielemariotti/changeloglib
* https://github.com/LarsWerkman/HoloColorPicker
* https://github.com/keyboardsurfer
* https://github.com/neopixl/PixlUI
